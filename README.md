# Hangman frontend

This is the repository for the frontend of the Hangman Game application.

To install dependencies run:

```bash
npm install
```

After successful installation the dev server can be started up with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command prints out the address of the application (by default its http://localhost:5173).

During development I used node version v18.16.0 (current LTS);
